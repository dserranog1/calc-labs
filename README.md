# Calculus Labs â€“ Integral Calculus (2025-1)

This repository contains a series of weekly **lab sessions** designed to complement an undergraduate course in **Integral Calculus**. The goal is to strengthen theoretical concepts through computational tools and interactive exploration.

## ðŸ’¡ About the labs

These labs are weekly 2-hour practical sessions aimed at students in their second semester of a computer science or engineering program.

Each lab is structured to:

- Reinforce key concepts from differential and integral calculus
- Use programming (in Python) to visualize and experiment with mathematical ideas
- Introduce modern scientific tools and libraries such as `numpy` and `matplotlib`
- Encourage the use of **LLMs (Large Language Models)** as assistants for programming and exploration â€” responsibly and with understanding

## ðŸ§° Tools used

- [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) â€“ for interactive notebooks
- Python 3.x
- NumPy â€“ numerical computing
- Matplotlib â€“ scientific plotting
- Markdown â€“ for documentation and instruction

---

## ðŸŒ± Who is this for?

- First-year university students learning calculus and programming at the same time
- Instructors or TAs looking for structured, modern labs to accompany a calculus course
- Anyone interested in visual, interactive approaches to learning mathematics with code

> Modern science is built not only with pencil and paper â€” but also with code, visualization, and computation.
